      <h1>Welcome to my site. <br>Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>

      <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
        If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

      <h2>My guarantee</h2>
      <p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it for a full refund. <b>No questions asked!</b></p>
